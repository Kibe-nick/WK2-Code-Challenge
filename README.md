Interactive Shopping List
This project is a JavaScript-based interactive shopping list application that demonstrates array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Objective
Develop a webpage that allows users to manage a shopping list by adding items, marking items as purchased, and clearing the list.

Requirements
Array
Use a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
DOM Manipulation
Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button.
Visual indication of purchased items, such as strikethrough text or a different background color.
Event Handling
Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Allow users to mark items as purchased by clicking on them.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
Bonus Features
Implement the ability for users to edit existing list items.
Persist the shopping list using local storage to maintain the list even after the page reloads.
Learning Outcomes
Practice iterating through arrays to access and manipulate list items dynamically.
Gain experience in modifying the DOM based on user interactions.
Reinforce understanding of event listeners and their role in creating interactive web applications.
