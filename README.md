# Interactive Shopping List

This project is a JavaScript-based interactive shopping list application that demonstrates array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Objective

Develop a webpage that allows users to manage a shopping list by adding items, marking items as purchased, and clearing the list.

## Requirements

### Array

- Uses a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

### DOM Manipulation

- Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
- Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button.
- Provide a visual indication of purchased items, such as strikethrough text or a different background color.

### Event Handling

- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
- Allow users to mark items as purchased by clicking on them.
- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.


## Learning Outcomes

- Practice iterating through arrays to access and manipulate list items dynamically.
- Gain experience in modifying the DOM based on user interactions.
- Reinforce understanding of event listeners and their role in creating interactive web applications.
